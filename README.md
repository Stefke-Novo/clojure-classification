# classification

Classification is process that's based on several steps of execution:
1. load data
2. describe data
3. define result data for machine learning
4. build function for building test and train set under constant random condition
5. build train machine learning algorithm
6. use machine learning alg. for training
7. build confusion matrix
8. get results


Classification project is consisted of several steps:
+ Load data
+ Describe data - presenting whole dataset on console
+ Create groups - creating test and train groups of data for training model 
+ Get train and test dataset - to distinguish test and train datasets by building deterministic shuffle 
+ Classification algorithm - creating classification algorithm based on train dataset and later testing it with test dataset
+ Confusion matrix - building confusion matrix for calculating statistic metrics like precision, efficiency, callback and f1 value

For that reason, project is separated into 6 documents with roles listed above:
1. load_data_function.clj
2. describe_data_function.clj
3. create_groups_function.clj
4. get_train_and_test_datasets.clj
5. classification_algorithm.clj
6. confusion_matrix.clj

Below will be presented functions that each of the files contains.
